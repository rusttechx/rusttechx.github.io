  topic: Cranelift - The All-Rust Codegen Alternative to LLVM (No C/C++)
  presenter: Nihal Pasham
  affiliation: Bosch Global Software Technologies
  time: "04:20 PM - 04.40 PM IST"
  room: 230

  abstract: |
    Cranelift is a lightweight, all-Rust code generation framework designed to overcome the complexities of LLVM. While LLVM has been the go-to choice for decades, its sheer size and steep learning curve make it difficult to navigate, even after 20 years. Cranelift simplifies compiler design and is poised to address the rising importance of compilers in today’s tech landscape. As hardware innovation accelerates, the ability to quickly adapt to new architectures, optimize for power or memory constraints, and improve performance is crucial. Cranelift’s streamlined design enables developers to efficiently tackle these challenges, with a focus on code portability, lower overhead, and faster code generation. 
    This talk will introduce Cranelift’s intermediate representation (IR), covering its use of types, SSA, and control flow graphs (CFGs). Attendees will also see how Cranelift simplifies Rust-to-IR workflows, provides powerful testing and visualization tools, and streamlines code analysis for modern compiler challenges. Whether you’re interested in compilers, Rust, or optimizing code for next-gen hardware, Cranelift offers a fresh, practical solution.

  abstract: |
    This talk presents a high-performance, resource-efficient translation service built with Rust microservices, delivering human-level translation quality across all European languages. By leveraging Rust's performance, safety, and concurrency, we developed a modular system using seven microservices, deployed on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). Key technical highlights include the use of the Axum web framework, SQLx for asynchronous database interactions, and Azure Entra for Single Sign-On (SSO) integration. The system is optimized for efficiency, with low-load microservices running on as little as 200 millicores of CPU and 256 MB of memory, achieving significant resource savings compared to other language implementations. We also share insights on building custom shared libraries to streamline development and improve maintainability. This work showcases the potential of Rust for building scalable, secure, and highly efficient microservices in production environments, contributing valuable lessons for the Rust community and cloud-native development.
